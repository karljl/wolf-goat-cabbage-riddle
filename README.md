# Wolf, goat and cabbage riddle

This is my implementation of the famous "Wolf, goat and cabbage problem" 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf,_goat_and_cabbage_problem) using Object-Oriented Programming in Python.

Also, the repository contains an unittest file meant as practicing writing tests.

TODO:
* Finish unittest for NewStateFinder class
